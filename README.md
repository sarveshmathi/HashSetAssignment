# HashSetAssignment


In this assignment, we wrote a program that analyzed the sentiment (positive or negative) of a sentence based on the words 
it contains by implementing methods that use the List, Set, and Map interfaces from the Java Collections Framework.

For completed details on this projects, refer to **Module-4-Programming-Assignment.pdf**.

**Learning Objectives**

* Become familiar with the methods in the java.util.List, java.util.Set, and java.util.Map interfaces
* Continue working with abstract data types by using only the interface of an implementation
* Apply what you have learned about how lists, sets, and maps work
* Get a better understanding of the difference between lists and sets
* Demonstrate that you can use lists, sets, and maps to solve real-world problems
* Gain experience writing Java code that reads an input file
